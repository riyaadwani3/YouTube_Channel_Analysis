# YouTube_Channel_Analysis

1. Connected the YouTube Data API for collecting the data.
2. Extracted the data of different channels with the help of their channel id's.
3. Created a dataframe and visualized it with the help of seaborn library.
4. After this, I extracted the videos of a perticular channel (here in this case channel name is 'Alex the Analyst').
5. Preprocessing it and get the video id's for the same channels.
6. And lastly collected the video details like views, comments, likes, title, etc, visualized it and stored it into the csv fil.
